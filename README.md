# displaypi
Turn a raspberry pi into an universal wifi or airplay display device (esp. for fairs)

The project is stalled due to some lacking informations at the moment, due to Corona and due the cancelling of most fairs I usually attend.

I assume to come back to the project in fall when the device is needed again.
